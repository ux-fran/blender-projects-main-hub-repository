# Welcome to the Blender Projects Main Hub by Fran 43CG! 🎨✨

This main repository is the central hub for all my Blender projects. Whether you're here for inspiration, learning, or just curiosity—welcome aboard! 🚀  

I’m documenting my journey in learning Blender, sharing how I plan, manage, and complete projects using **Agile project management** principles. Each project has its own repository with detailed backlogs, Kanban boards, and learnings. Everything is tracked here to **stay on track, reflect on lessons learned, and keep the momentum going**.

## 🚀 My Agile Workflow for Blender Projects

I apply **Agile project management** to my creative process to stay organized and finish projects efficiently. While GitHub is traditionally used for version control, I’m using it as a **project management tool** for my Blender projects.  

Each project repo contains a backlog of tasks, progress tracking with Kanban boards, and detailed documentation about what I’ve learned. This way, I keep everything in one place—no scattered to-do lists or forgotten notes! By breaking down big goals into smaller, manageable steps, I make steady progress without feeling overwhelmed.

Note: I don’t version control my Blender files in GitHub. Instead, I track my project progress and document insights to help others learn and stay on track.
